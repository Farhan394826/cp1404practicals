# Reflection

## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My estimate accuracy was generally poor. I often underestimated the time required to complete tasks, especially for the later practicals.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
Over time, my estimates improved slightly as I gained a better understanding of the practical requirements and the complexity of tasks. However, I still struggled with time management.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I learned that breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces helps provide better estimates. Also, factoring in time for debugging and reviews is essential.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
I learned that getting feedback from peers can highlight areas for improvement that I might overlook. Sometimes, other people suggested better ways to write cleaner or more efficient code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
By reviewing others' code, I learned alternative approaches to solving problems. For practicals 6, 7, and 8, I reviewed good code and didn't find any mistakes. This made me realize some peers might have a better grasp of the concepts than I do, which motivated me to improve.

### Good Code Review 1
**[Code Review for Practical 6](https://github.com/Chenxi219/cp1404practicals/pull/2)**

**Explanation:**  
I noted that the code was clean and well-structured. There were no errors, and the functions followed single responsibility principles. 

### Good Code Review 2
**[Code Review for Practical 7](https://github.com/MuhtasimFerdaus/cp1404practicals/pull/5)**

**Explanation:**  
This code review focused on their use of proper error handling and well-written comments. I mentioned that their variable naming conventions were clear and that they used modular design effectively.

## Practicals

### Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would make it so there is no time limit for the practicals. This would give students more flexibility to balance their workload and focus on mastering the content without the stress of deadlines.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I did well in understanding and applying the concepts of classes. I was able to design and implement class-based solutions effectively, even when other aspects of the practicals were challenging.
